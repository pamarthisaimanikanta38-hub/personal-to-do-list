# Personal To-Do List Management System

A simple, beautiful, responsive, and fully functional **Personal To-Do List Management System** designed for college student mini-project evaluations and lab demonstrations.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Personal To-Do List Management System** is a lightweight client-side web application designed to help individuals organize daily activities, assign task categories, track priority levels, monitor progress, and persist data across browser sessions.

### Key Highlights:
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
- **100% Offline Capability**: Runs directly in any web browser without an internet connection, Node.js, external CDNs, or web servers.
- **Persistent Data**: Automatically retains all tasks across page refreshes and browser restarts using browser `localStorage`.
- **Reference-Accurate UI**: Designed to match modern productivity dashboards with a dark blue header, color-coded priority and status badges, and an intuitive bottom dashboard.

## 2. Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Semantic structure for task inputs, dashboard cards, filters, and tables. |
| **CSS3** | Modern styling, responsive flexbox/grid layout, and custom color-coded badges. |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | DOM manipulation, task CRUD logic, real-time search, multi-criteria filtering, and validation. |
| **Browser LocalStorage** | Client-side persistent data storage (JSON format). |

> **Important**: This project uses **no external libraries or frameworks** (No React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, MySQL, or external APIs).

## 3. Project Folder Structure

```text
Personal-ToDo-List/
│
├── index.html       # Application layout and markup structure
├── style.css        # Visual styles, color scheme, typography, and responsive design
├── script.js        # Core logic, CRUD operations, search/filters, and LocalStorage
└── README.md        # Comprehensive documentation and project guide
```

### Purpose of Every File:

1. **`index.html`**:
   - Defines the structural elements of the application.
   - Contains the dark blue header with the checklist icon, the task creation/edit form, search and filter controls, the task data table, and the bottom feature dashboard.
   - Embeds lightweight inline SVG icons so the application works completely offline.

2. **`style.css`**:
   - Implements the complete visual design inspired by modern dashboard aesthetics.
   - Styles the header, rounded input controls, hover states, action buttons, table borders, and responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.
   - Configures the custom badge colors:
     - **High Priority**: Soft red pill.
     - **Medium / Low Priority**: Soft green pills.
     - **Pending Status**: Soft yellow pill.
     - **Completed Status**: Soft green pill.

3. **`script.js`**:
   - Implements the interactive logic for the entire system:
     - **Create**: Adds new tasks with validation (prevents empty submissions).
     - **Read / View**: Renders tasks dynamically into the table.
     - **Update / Edit**: Loads existing task details into the form and allows updating.
     - **Delete**: Prompts the user with a confirmation modal before deleting.
     - **Search & Filter**: Real-time filtering by task title, category, priority, and completion status.
     - **LocalStorage Integration**: Automatically loads and persists tasks in JSON format.
     - **Default Seeding**: Pre-loads sample tasks matching the demonstration blueprint upon first load.

4. **`README.md`**:
   - Project documentation covering setup, features, code explanation, and college evaluation questions.
